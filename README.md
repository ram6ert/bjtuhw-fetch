# BJTUHW FETCH

## Notice

This was a simple web API interface for fetching, caching and serving homework data from the origin server.  

Because of the denial of access from the origin server, we could no longer fetch homework from it. So I marked this repository as archived.

## Installation

To install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

To run:

```bash
bun run index.ts
```

This project was created using `bun init` in bun v1.2.5. [Bun](https://bun.sh) is a fast all-in-one JavaScript runtime.
